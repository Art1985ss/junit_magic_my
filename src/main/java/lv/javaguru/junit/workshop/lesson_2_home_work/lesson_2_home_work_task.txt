Write tests and implementation code
for TaxCalculator using JUnit framework.

TaxCalculator

"Email" rule:
4) Send email to VID, when income is more then 100000.
Think about exceptions and how to test it.


Write tests first!
Tests should drive implementation!
Use Test Driven Development (TDD) approach!
After all refactor your production code and tests!
