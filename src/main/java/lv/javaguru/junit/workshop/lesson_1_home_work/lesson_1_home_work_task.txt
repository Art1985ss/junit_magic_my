FizzBuzz kata - introduction to TDD
http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/

For numbers 1 through 100,

Stage 1:
	1. if the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz;
	2. if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz;
	3. if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print FizzBuzz;
	   else, print the number.

Stage 2:
	4. A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it has a 3 in it
	5. A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it has a 5 in it

HOME work: try to implement Enterprise version of FizzBuzz.
1. Create common interface for rules (1-5).
2. Move each rule (1-5) to separate class.
3. Invoke rules in main class in correct order.
4. Write tests for Enterprise version of FizzBuzz.

Write tests first!
